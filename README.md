Project Overview
StutterAI aims to assist individuals who stutter by providing real-time insights into their speech patterns. Using the Wav2Vec 2.0 model as a foundation, StutterAI classifies specific stuttering events such as prolongations, blocks, and repetitions at the word level, providing a detailed analysis. It also generates a severity score based on disfluency frequency and duration, which can be used for further treatment.

Features
Real-Time Stutter Detection: Identifies stuttering events in real-time as users speak.
Stuttering Classification: Categorizes stuttering types, including prolongation, block, interjection, and repetition.
Severity Scoring: Provides a customized severity score based on disfluency patterns, allowing for tailored feedback.
Personalized Feedback: Integrates with a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) reinforcement learning agent to deliver actionable feedback aimed at reducing stuttering severity over time.


Use the interface to record or upload an audio file.
The system will process the file, detect stuttering patterns, and display classification results and severity scores.
Accessing Feedback

The model will provide personalized feedback based on detected stuttering events, which users can follow to improve fluency.
Model Details
Wav2Vec 2.0: Used as the primary model for feature extraction and stuttering detection.
Classification: Stuttering events are classified on a word-specific level, allowing for targeted feedback.
Severity Scoring: Stuttering events are scored based on frequency and duration, generating an overall severity score.
Reinforcement Learning with PPO: A PPO agent tailors feedback for each user, aimed at gradually reducing the stuttering severity score.
Dataset
SEP-28k: A public dataset specifically tailored for stuttering analysis, providing labeled audio files.
Synthetic Dataset: In addition, a synthetic dataset is generated using Text-to-Speech (TTS) for training stuttering event severity scoring, capturing controlled disfluency patterns.
Technologies Used
Python
Hugging Face Transformers for Wav2Vec 2.0
Google Text-to-Speech API for synthetic data generation
PyTorch for model training and inference
Streamlit for a web-based interface (if a GUI is included)
Future Improvements
Expanded Model Fine-Tuning: Further fine-tune the model for higher accuracy in detecting nuanced stuttering patterns.
Enhanced PPO Feedback: Refine the feedback provided by the PPO agent for even more personalized guidance.
Real-Time Deployment: Improve performance to enable real-time stuttering detection and feedback on low-latency devices.
